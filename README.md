### GTK Theming

In case you use **GTK4/LibAdwaita** apps, you will have to Launch the toolkit from the dock, head on over to **4. Customization** select option `u` to apply the fix & update both GTK as well as KDE themes to latest versions from source. Only works for the default ðŸŽ¨**Layan Theme**ðŸŽ¨.

### Swap + Hibernate

I am currently reworking this option. Due to that, it's been disabled. Will be reactivated once work is done on the next ISO. Until then you can still select **Swap File** in case you need it. Thanks for your understanding.

### Included Features

Some features available via the toolkit were already applied on the ISO, since it was initially created for Vanilla Arch. Find the list of what has already been applied below :
