#### Get new features

If you already are on **XeroLinux**, any version, all you have to do, to get new changes in, is to run option **n. Apply latest XeroLinux specific changes/updates.** under 1st option in the toolkit. That way you do not need to grab new ISO n reinstall to get them. As shown in image below...
